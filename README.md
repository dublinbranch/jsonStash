# jsonStash
json function based on majestic rapidjson

If we are in trouble please note you can use a custom function in case of error, default is quite brute (abort)

Our normal way is to call an excpetion. Instead

Such excpetion is ... well handled by a custom exception handler

That togheter with another amazing library (https://github.com/bombela/backward-cpp) will print you the stack trace of the json error!
